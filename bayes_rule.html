    <h1>Bayes Rule and the Basics of C++</h1>
    <h2> The basics types of probabilities </h2>
    <p> 
        To understand how many tools work in modern bioinformatics, it is important to have a firm grip on Bayes Rule. It is also a concept that, 
        when mastered, suddenly can change how one sees and acts in the world, as the following applications will highlight. A common method of 
        solving problems computer science is to use maximum likelihood estimation. This entails finding a solution to a problem such that the likelihood
        is maximized, given a set of observations. To put this in symbolic terms, given a model with parameters &Theta; and a data set <i>D</i>, the 
        maximum likelihood estimate for &Theta; is that value that maximizes <i>P(D|&Theta;)</i>.

        The five basic types of probabilities that are used within the application of Bayes Rule are <i>prior</i>, <i>conditional</i>, <i>joint</i>,
        <i>marginal</i>, and <i>posterior</i>.
